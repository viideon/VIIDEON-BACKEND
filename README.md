# Serverless Framework Node Express API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple Node Express API service, backed by DynamoDB database, running on AWS Lambda using the traditional Serverless Framework.


## Anatomy of the template

This template configures a single function, `api`, which is responsible for handling all incoming requests thanks to the `httpApi` event. To learn more about `httpApi` event configuration options, please refer to [httpApi event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/). As the event is configured in a way to accept all incoming requests, `express` framework is responsible for routing and handling requests internally. Implementation takes advantage of `serverless-http` package, which allows you to wrap existing `express` applications. To learn more about `serverless-http`, please refer to corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http). Additionally, it also handles provisioning of a DynamoDB database that is used for storing data about users. The `express` application exposes two endpoints, `POST /users` and `GET /user/{userId}`, which allow to create and retrieve users.

## Usage

### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project-dev (196s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project-dev-api (766 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [`httpApi` event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/). Additionally, in current configuration, the DynamoDB table will be removed when running `serverless remove`. To retain the DynamoDB table even after removal of the stack, add `DeletionPolicy: Retain` to its resource definition.

### Configuration

The app uses AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to provide configuration details to the application. You'll want to ensure the following parameters are configured:

**NOTE: `environment` in the configuration items match the `--stage` value used during deployment (ie, `dev` or `prod`).**

* `/{environment}/viideon/appDomain` - full URL to the app you're currently working with (ie, `http://localhost:3000` for dev or `https://test.app.viideon.com` for a higher environment.
* `/{environment}/viideon/fromEmail` - email that is used as the from email address (ie `contact@viideon.com`)
* `/{environment}/viideon/gmail/clientId` - Client ID from the Google OAuth configuration
* `/{environment}/viideon/gmail/clientSecret` - Client Secret from the Google OAuth configuration
* `/{environment}/viideon/gmail/tokenObjectPath` - Token Object Path from the Google OAuth configuration (ie `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`)
* `/{environment}/viideon/jwt/secretKey` - Secret key used to secure the JWT tokens (this is not used anymore)
* `/{environment}/viideon/sendgrid/apiKey` - Sendgrid API key to use when sending email via Sendgrid
